So this is it, almost the end of the year, Still having a lot of work in the underground but before publish new stuff about my 'entrepreneur story', I would like to put some light on a project I'm working on it is called FakeStoreJs.


fakeStoreJS, It provides a quick solution to mock data (or at least I believe it does), usefull when doing test or in developement mode when there is no access method to a database yet.


No need to know much more about it, but well go check this out, and please, any feedback are welcome !!
