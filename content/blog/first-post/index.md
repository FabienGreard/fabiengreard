It has been months... Maybe years that I was thinking about writing. I love reading blogs.

I read over thousand of blogs by years, discovering ideas, thoughts, new projects of passionate and successful people by clicking over the internet.
This always amused me, everyone has access to it, better they want you to read them !

Honestly, it is probably going to be terrible at first, messy, plenty of grammars error and misspelling, writing is hard, no one can wake up as a good writer, it takes time.
Thus, joining the big family of blogs is just another step I'm willing to take to improve my skills.
