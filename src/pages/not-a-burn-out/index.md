title: It has been a while...

So I‘ve been busy with work for the last months.
What have I done you may ask? Well, not that much, but you said you‘ve been busy working? Yes, I said that however I worked poorly, took me ages to perform simple tasks.

And after a while working overnight and with the accumulated stuff I ended up with a nice and great burning out therefore I was doing nothing.

To sum up It has been a while and during that time I‘ve done nothing great. WoW isn't it a trifle arsh? Yes, it is, but I need to be 100% clear with myself and I did shit.
 
So where is this article going? I wanted to write down my failure to acknowledge it and to overpass it, so basically this is a warning article towards myself.

I took a moment out of everything to think about you I should avoid and what I should do to help myself.

So here is a list of things I wish to reduce in the future : 

Slacking 
Overworking on meaningless stuff
Getting isolated

And for the opposite, I end up doing a schedule, like the one we had in college, maybe this is what I am missing, I never had one since I left the university and since I‘m struggling with time, so I‘ve down one with all the tasks I want to complete each week such as : 

Going to the gym
Working for my clients
Working for myself 
Cleaning
Learning
Gaming
And some free time

So from the 16th of January 2020 and for one complete month, I will have my life manage by a piece of paper. So I gave myself and you‘all a Rendez-vous on February 16th! 

Until next time,
peace.
