  <h1>FakeStoreJs a way to quickly mock data</h1>
</a>

<p>
So this is it, almost the end of the year, Still having a lot of work in the underground but before publish new stuff about my 'entrepreneur story', I would like to put some light on a project I'm working on it is called FakeStoreJs.
</p>
<br>
<p>
fakeStoreJS,
It provides a quick solution to mock data (or at least I believe it does), usefull when doing test or in developement mode when there is no access method to a database yet.
</p>
<br>
<p>
No need to know much more about it, but well go check this out, and please, any feedback are welcome !!
