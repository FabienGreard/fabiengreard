It has been months... Maybe years that I was thinking about writing. I love reading blogs.

Honestly, it is probably going to be terrible at first, messy, plenty of grammars error and misspelling, writing is hard, no one can wake up as a good writer, it takes time.
Thus, joining the big family of blogs is just another step I'm willing to take to improve my skills.
