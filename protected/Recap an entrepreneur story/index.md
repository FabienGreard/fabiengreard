  <h1>Recap - An entrepreneur story</h1>
</a>

As this is my second post, I'm still nervous about writing, this (An entrepreneur story) will be published every month, I will discuss what I've done into my life as a (beginner) entrepreneur and how I launch my first startup with my Associate Thomas.

This month I will write about what we have done from the last 3-4 months until now.
